## Manheim API Integration

This bot uses the official Manheim Valuations API to retrieve auction data. You'll need to register for API access at [Manheim's Developer Portal](https://developer.manheim.com) and obtain client credentials (client ID and client secret) to use this bot.

### API Environments

Manheim provides two environments:
- **UAT (Test)**: Used for development and testing (`https://uat.api.manheim.com`)
- **Production**: Used for live applications (`https://api.manheim.com`)

You can switch between environments by setting the `USE_MANHEIM_UAT` variable in your `.env` file.

### API Endpoints

The bot uses the following Manheim API endpoints:
- `/oauth2/token` - For authentication
- `/valuations/vin/{vin}` - For VIN-based valuations
- `/valuations/vin/{vin}/{subseries}` - For VIN with subseries
- `/valuations/vin/{vin}/{subseries}/{transmission}` - For VIN with subseries and transmission
- `/valuations/years/{year}/makes/{make}/models/{model}` - For Year/Make/Model-based valuations

### Example VIN

For testing in the UAT environment, you can use this example VIN:
- WBA3C1C5XFP853102

Example queries:
```
/vin WBA3C1C5XFP853102
/vin WBA3C1C5XFP853102 color=WHITE grade=3.5 odometer=20000 region=NE
